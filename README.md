A sample library of a Hungarian "prime" zither in G. Not really sure what the proper name is, it might be better to call it some kind of dulcimer, but it's a rectangular instrument with over a dozen strings, mostly tuned to G, with two melody courses and the rest as drones. Sampled strummed down, strummed up, and as melody strings only.

At this point the samples need their tails faded out, so it's not completely done and ready for release yet, but it does make a sound and can be played. Seems decent for relaxing, meditational strums.
