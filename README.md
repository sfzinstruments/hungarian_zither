A sample library of a Hungarian "prime" zither in G. It's a rectangular instrument with over a dozen strings, mostly tuned to G, with two melody courses and the rest as drones. Sampled strummed down, strummed up, and as melody strings only.

This virtual instrument can't do everything the real thing can (which would be dense strums across part of the string range, and tremolo picking on the melody strings) but seems decent for relaxing, meditational strums.
