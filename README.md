A sample library of a Hungarian "prime" zither in G. Not really sure what the proper name is, it might be better to call it some kind of dulcimer, but it's a rectangular instrument with over a dozen strings, mostly tuned to G, with two melody courses and the rest as drones. Sampled strummed down, strummed up, and as melody strings only.
